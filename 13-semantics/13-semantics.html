          "The only reason you had me was so you could get a maid you wouldn't have to pay," you'll say bitterly, dragging the vacuum cleaner out of the closet.

          "That's right!" I'll say. "Thirteen years ago I knew the carpets would need vacuuming around now, and having a baby seemed to be the cheapest and easiest way to get the job done. Now kindly get on with it."

          "If you weren't my mother, this would be illegal," you'll say, seething as you unwind the power cord and plug it into the wall outlet.

          5. Create a search results page in this folder and link to it from here.

          In this new page you create…

          After a user has entered a search term, we need to display the results of the search back to the user, so that they can click through to the page(s) that match their search.

          This page needs the following structure:

            - A header that includes:
              - the name of the page
              - a summary of the number of results
              - the entered search term.
              - a link back to search again, at "/search"
            - A list of page results that match the term, which should include:
              - The page title
              - A link to the page
              - A summary of where the entered search term matches the page

          Here is the entered search term: "critical thinking"

          And here are the results, with their excerpts:

            Title: "Wikipedia: Critical Thinking"
            URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking
            Excerpt:
